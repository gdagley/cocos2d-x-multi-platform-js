This is an attempt to create pull the [multi-platform Cocos2d-x Javascript template](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/tree/master/template/multi-platform-js) out and set it up in a way that it could easily bootstrap a new project.

**This is a work in progress and is still open to changes in project structure.**

## To do:

* Make it easy to rename the project (files, folders, references)
* Make it easy to make sure latest shared Javascript source and assets are available in each platform build.
* Make it easy to test the Javascript code.
* Provide examples of custom JS bindings
* Anything else?

## Known Issues:

* Current cocos2d-x is [cocos2d-2.1rc0-x-2.1.2](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/tree/cocos2d-2.1rc0-x-2.1.2)
* proj.win32 has not been fixed and tested.
